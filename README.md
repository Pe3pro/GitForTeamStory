## Our Wonderful Story

1. Once upon a time, there was a castle so big it needed its own Wi-Fi password.

2. Everything was peaceful until one day a dragon appeared!
But wait—it started charging itself with a USB cable.
Turns out, it wasn’t a real dragon at all but a dragon-shaped robot built by the castle’s part-time intern. **dragon**.

3. “Quick! Don’t unplug the dragon-robot!” shouted Dr. Blip, the lead scientist.
Naturally, someone unplugged it anyway. Sparks flew, alarms blared, and the castle Wi-Fi crashed dramatically.


4. Amid the chaos, someone accidentally hit the teleportation button on Dr. Blip’s experimental remote.
With a loud POOF! everyone vanished—
and reappeared in the middle of a scorching desert, where a glowing treasure chest shimmered in the sand.


5. Next to the chest lay a dusty map.
“This must be the way home!” said Luna, the brave assistant.
She followed it through forests, rivers, and even a sandwich shop—
only to discover the map led her right back to the castle ruins.
(Someone really should’ve added GPS directions to that thing.)

6. Just as everyone reunited, a mysterious pirate burst from the chest yelling,
“Arrr! Let’s go to space!”
No one knew why there was a pirate in the chest, but honestly, it had been a long day, so they all agreed.  

7. Moments later, Dr. Blip’s emergency rocket ![rocket](img/rocket.png) blasted off into the sky.
In orbit, they encountered a floating cat in a spacesuit calmly licking an asteroid.

8. The cat waved and said, “Meow meow, can I have some snacks, please?”
Everyone froze—because cats can’t talk... right?

9. Suddenly, the scenery flickered like a glitchy video game.
They found themselves standing in a forest again, staring at a glowing notebook floating in the air.
When it opened, words began writing themselves across the page.
    

10. “Wait a second,” said the detective (who appeared just in time to solve everything).
“We’re not real—we’re characters inside this notebook!”

And with that revelation, the story started erasing itself…
until only one sentence remained:

“Once upon a time, there was a castle so big it needed its own Wi-Fi password.”

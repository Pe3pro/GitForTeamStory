## Our Wonderful Story

1. OOnce upon a time, there was a castle so big it needed its own Wi-Fi password.

2. Suddenly, a dragon appeared!
   But wait… it started charging itself with a USB cable.
   So yes, it was actually a dragon-shaped robot built by a part-time intern. **dragon**.

3. Dr. Blip, the lead scientist, yelled, “Quick! Don’t unplug the dragon-robot!”
But nobody listened, so sparks flew everywhere and the Wi-Fi went down.

4. After that, everyone got lost (or maybe teleported?) and somehow there was a **treasure chest**…

5. Someone found a map, but it had no directions.Still, she followed her instincts through forests and hills.In the end, she realized   the  map was leading her — back home.
   (TODO: add an image of the map?)  

6. “Let’s go to space!” shouted the pirate (although there was no pirate before this).  

7. Suddenly, the rocket ![rocket](img/rocket.png) blasted off into the sky and encountered a floating kitty in space. Everyone was very surprised!

8. And then, the cat walked in and said, "Meow meow, can I have some food, please?"

9. In the forest, the detective discovered… something.  
   (What did they find?)  

10. The ending… well, we don’t really have one. Please fix this.

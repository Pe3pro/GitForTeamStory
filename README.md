## Our Wonderful Story

1. Once upon a time, there was a **castle**.  
   ![castle](img1.png)

2. Then suddenly, a **dragon** appeared… but maybe it was actually a **robot**?  
   (Nobody is sure yet.)

3. The scientist shouted something very important but nobody wrote it down.  

4. After that, everyone got lost (or maybe teleported?) and somehow there was a **treasure chest**…

5. Someone found a map, but it had no directions.  
   (TODO: add an image of the map?)  

6. “Let’s go to space!” shouted the pirate (although there was no pirate before this).  

7. Suddenly, the rocket ![rocket](img/rocket.png) blasted off into the sky and encountered a floating kitty in space. Everyone was very surprised!

8. And then, the cat walked in and said, "Meow meow, can I have some food, please?"

9. In the forest, the detective discovered… something.  
   (What did they find?)  

10. The ending… well, we don’t really have one. Please fix this.
